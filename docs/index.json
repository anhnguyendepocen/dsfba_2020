Teaching assistants  Aleksandr Shemendyuk Maximilian Aigner Hasini Gunawardena Ilia Azizi  Course Readings There will be no mandatory reading. However, weekly readings related to the lectures are strongly recommended, and additional ressources will undoubtedly be useful.\nEvaluation Evaluation will be based on four assignments (40%) and a final project (60%). For the first three assignments, the platform Ed will be used. For the fourth assignment as well as the project, students will have to provide detailed written reports. Additionally, for the project, students will give a presentation during the last lecture.\nThe final grade will be calculated using the following formula: $$GRADE = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{HW_i}{4} \\cdot 40 + PR \\cdot 60}{100},$$ where $HW_1$, $HW_2$, $HW_3$, $HW_4$, and $PR$ are respectively the grades for the assignments and final project, on a scale from 0 to 100. This final grade will then be adjusted on a scale from 1 to 6.\nRetake exam The retake consists in asking the failing students to do a new final project and present it.\n"

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\nBooks Advanced R  The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side. Hadley Wickham  R for Data Science  This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham  R Markdown: The Definitive Guide  The document format \u0026ldquo;R Markdown\u0026rdquo; was first introduced in the knitr package (Xie 2015, 2020c) in early 2012. The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, knitr supported several authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, including LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Textile. Looking back over the five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the most popular document format, which is what we expected. Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund  Online learning Coding club\u0026rsquo;s tutorials  Our mission is to create a fun and supportive environment where we develop programming and statistics skills together, using R.\nWe want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn, and here we will share our experience.\n Datacamp\u0026rsquo;s free R tutorial and Try R by Code School Both sites provide interactive lessons that will get you writing real code in minutes. They are a great place to make mistakes and test out new skills. You are told immediately when you go wrong and given a chance to fix your code.\nWriting functions in R This course will teach you the fundamentals of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.\nIntroduction to the tidyverse This is an introduction to the dplyr and ggplot2 packages through exploration and visualization of country data over time. This is a suitable course for people who have no or limited experience in R and are interested in learning to perform data analysis.\nData visualisation with ggplot2 Covers the basics of ggplot2. Followed by part 2 which covers more advanced topics.\nExploratory data analysis in R: a case study This course brings ggplot2 and dplyr into action in an in-depth analysis of United Nations voting data.

	"content": " R Foundations In this tutorial, you’ll get an overview of the basic programming concepts in R and main data types. It’s just enough to get you up and running essential R code. However, for true “beginners”, we highly recommend going through Advanced R - Chapter ‘Foundations’ from which the content of this assignment is (mostly) inspired by.\nR, RStudio, Installation  R is a programming language for statistical analysis RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) for R in which we write and execute R code, plot things and write reports. Installation guidelines and details (Mac, Windows, Linux)  To follow the tutorial, you can start R Studio and execute statements from the code chunks in the R Console.\n Libraries R uses different libraries or packages to load specific functions (read excel files, talk to Twitter, generate plots).\n# To install package from the console, note the quotation marks! # install.packages(\u0026quot;name_of_package\u0026quot;) # load package in environment library(mgcv)  Ex. 0 As a starting point you can install a package that we’ll extensively use throughout the semester:\n tidyverse    Assignment In R, we assign values (numbers, characters, data frames) to objects (vectors, matrices, variables). To do so, we use the \u0026lt;- operator:\n# name_of_object \u0026lt;- value an_object \u0026lt;- 2 another_object \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;some string\u0026quot; # inspect object\u0026#39;s value an_object #\u0026gt; [1] 2 print(another_object) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;some string\u0026quot;  Data Structures R’s base data structures can be organised by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types).\n   Homogeneous Heterogeneous    1d Atomic vector List  2d Matrix Data frame  nd Array      Vectors The basic data structure in R is the vector. Vectors can be of two kinds: atomic vectors and lists. They have three common properties:\n Type, typeof(), what it is. Length, length(), how many elements it contains. Attributes, attributes(), additional arbitrary metadata.  However, atomic vectors and lists differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.\nThere are four common types of atomic vectors:\n logical integer double (often called numeric) character  Atomic vectors are usually created with c(), short for combine:\ndbl_var \u0026lt;- c(1, 2.5, 4.5) # with the L suffix, you get an integer rather than a double int_var \u0026lt;- c(1L, 6L, 10L) # use TRUE and FALSE (or T and F) to create logical vectors log_var \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F) chr_var \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;these are\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;some strings\u0026quot;) int_var \u0026lt;- c(1L, 6L, 10L) typeof(int_var) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; is.integer(int_var) #\u0026gt; [1] TRUE  Lists List objects can hold elements of any type, including lists. You construct lists by using list() instead of c():\nx \u0026lt;- list(1:3, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9)) str(x) #\u0026gt; List of 4 #\u0026gt; $ : int [1:3] 1 2 3 #\u0026gt; $ : chr \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; #\u0026gt; $ : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE #\u0026gt; $ : num [1:2] 2.3 5.9  Attributes All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object. Attributes can be thought of as a named list (with unique names). They can be accessed individually with attr() or all at once (as a list) with attributes().\ny \u0026lt;- 1:10 attr(y, \u0026quot;my_attribute\u0026quot;) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;This is a vector\u0026quot; # inspect the attribute of y attr(y, \u0026quot;my_attribute\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;This is a vector\u0026quot;  Matrices and arrays Adding a dim attribute to an atomic vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array. A special case of the array is the matrix, which has two dimensions. Matrices and arrays are created with matrix() and array(), or by using the assignment form of dim():\n# two scalar arguments to specify rows and columns a \u0026lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3, nrow = 2) # one vector argument to describe all dimensions b \u0026lt;- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2)) # you can also modify an object in place by setting dim() c \u0026lt;- 1:6 dim(c) \u0026lt;- c(3, 2) c #\u0026gt; [,1] [,2] #\u0026gt; [1,] 1 4 #\u0026gt; [2,] 2 5 #\u0026gt; [3,] 3 6 length() and names() have high-dimensional generalisations:\n length() generalises to nrow() and ncol() for matrices, and dim() for arrays.\n names() generalises to rownames() and colnames() for matrices, and dimnames(), a list of character vectors, for arrays.\n  c() generalises to cbind() and rbind() for matrices, and to abind() (provided by the abind package) for arrays. You can transpose a matrix with t(); the generalised equivalent for arrays is aperm().\nYou can test if an object is a matrix or array using is.matrix() and is.array(), or by looking at the length of the dim(). as.matrix() and as.array() make it easy to turn an existing vector into a matrix or array.\n Data frames A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and if used systematically makes data analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the matrix and the list. This means that a data frame has names(), colnames(), and rownames(), although names() and colnames() are the same thing. The length() of a data frame is the length of the underlying list and so is the same as ncol(); nrow() gives the number of rows.\ndf \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;)) str(df) #\u0026gt; \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 3 obs. of 2 variables: #\u0026gt; $ x: int 1 2 3 #\u0026gt; $ y: chr \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; You can combine data frames using cbind() and rbind():\ncbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1)) #\u0026gt; x y z #\u0026gt; 1 1 a 3 #\u0026gt; 2 2 b 2 #\u0026gt; 3 3 c 1  Subsetting vectors Let’s explore the different types of subsetting with a simple vector, x.\nx \u0026lt;- c(2, 4, 3, 5) Positive integers return elements at the specified positions:\nx[c(3, 1)] #\u0026gt; [1] 3 2 Duplicated indices yield duplicated values:\nx[c(1, 1)] #\u0026gt; [1] 2 2 Real numbers are silently truncated to integers:\nx[c(2, 9)] #\u0026gt; [1] 4 NA Negative integers omit elements at the specified positions:\nx[-c(3, 1)] #\u0026gt; [1] 4 5 You can’t mix positive and negative integers in a single subset: x[c(-1, 2)] is not allowed.\nLogical vectors select elements where the corresponding logical value is TRUE. This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector:\nx[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)] #\u0026gt; [1] 2 4 x[x \u0026gt; 3] #\u0026gt; [1] 4 5 A missing value in the index always yields a missing value in the output:\nx[c(TRUE, TRUE, NA, FALSE)] #\u0026gt; [1] 2 4 NA Nothing returns the original vector. This is not useful for vectors but is very useful for matrices, data frames, and arrays. It can also be useful in conjunction with assignment.\nx[] #\u0026gt; [1] 2 4 3 5 Zero returns a zero-length vector. This is not something you usually do on purpose, but it can be helpful for generating test data.\nx[0] #\u0026gt; numeric(0) If the vector is named, you can also use character vectors to return elements with matching names:\n(y \u0026lt;- setNames(x, letters[1:4])) #\u0026gt; a b c d #\u0026gt; 2 4 3 5 y[c(\u0026quot;d\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)] #\u0026gt; d c a #\u0026gt; 5 3 2 Like integer indices, you can repeat indices:\ny[c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)] #\u0026gt; a a a #\u0026gt; 2 2 2 When subsetting with [ names are always matched exactly\nz \u0026lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2) z[c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;)] #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; NA NA  Subsetting lists, matricies and data frames Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using [ will always return a list; [[ and $, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.\nYou can subset higher-dimensional structures in three ways:\n With multiple vectors. With a single vector. With a matrix.  a \u0026lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3) colnames(a) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;) # multiple vectors a[1:2, ] #\u0026gt; A B C #\u0026gt; [1,] 1 4 7 #\u0026gt; [2,] 2 5 8 df \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3]) # selecting by value of certain vector df[df$x == 2, ] #\u0026gt; x y z #\u0026gt; 2 2 2 b  Importing data in R The following checklist makes it easier to import data correctly into R:\n The first row is maybe reserved for the header, while the first column is used to identify the sampling unit; Avoid names, values or fields with blank spaces, otherwise each word will be interpreted as a separate variable, resulting in errors that are related to the number of elements per line in your data set; Short names are preferred over longer names; Try to avoid using names that contain symbols such as ?, $,%, ^, \u0026amp;, *, (, ),-,#, ?,,,\u0026lt;,\u0026gt;, /, |, \\, [ ,] ,{, and }; Make sure that any missing values in your data set are indicated with NA.  library(readr) # import data from .txt file df \u0026lt;- read_table( \u0026quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.txt\u0026quot;, col_names = FALSE) df #\u0026gt; # A tibble: 5 x 3 #\u0026gt; X1 X2 X3 #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; 1 1 6 a #\u0026gt; 2 2 7 b #\u0026gt; 3 3 8 c #\u0026gt; 4 4 9 d #\u0026gt; 5 5 10 e # import data from .csv file df \u0026lt;- read.table( \u0026quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.csv\u0026quot;, header = TRUE, sep = \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;)  Functions Standard format for defining a function in R:\nmy_function_name \u0026lt;- function(arg1 = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, arg2 = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;) { # \u0026#39;cat\u0026#39; is used for concatenating strings merged_string \u0026lt;- cat(arg1, arg2) # if not specified, last evaluated object is returned return(merged_string) } # call a function elsewhere from code arg1 \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot; arg2 \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;World!\u0026quot; a_greeting \u0026lt;- my_function_name(arg1, arg2) #\u0026gt; Hello World! print(a_greeting) #\u0026gt; NULL CRAN - the curated repository of R packages provides millions of functions that you could use to tackle data. You simply need to install a package, and then call the function from your R code function_name(somearguments). For example, the package stats helps you in fitting linear models through the function lm():\nlibrary(stats) x \u0026lt;- rnorm(500) y \u0026lt;- x*4 + rnorm(500) lm.fit \u0026lt;- lm(y~x, data = data.frame(x, y)) print(lm.fit) #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Call: #\u0026gt; lm(formula = y ~ x, data = data.frame(x, y)) #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Coefficients: #\u0026gt; (Intercept) x #\u0026gt; -0.03292 3.98563 How many functions have been used in the example? What does rnorm mean? You can get informed about any R function by using its documentation ?function_name or ?packageName::function_name.\n Cheat sheets Base R Cheat sheet  Data Types Cheat sheet   Try it yourself! Exercise 1 Try to figure out the answers without executing the code. Check your answers in R Studio.\nGiven the vector: x \u0026lt;- c(\"ww\", \"ee\", \"ff\", \"uu\", \"kk\"), what will be the output for x[c(2,3)] ?\n Let a \u0026lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8) and b \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), what will be the output for the R expression max(a[b])?\n Is it possible to apply the function my_function_name using x and a as arguments?\n   Exercise 2 Consider a vector x such that: x \u0026lt;- c(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29) Write an R statement that will return a list X2 with components of value: x*2, x/2, sqrt(x) and names ‘x*2’, ‘x/2’, ‘sqrt(x)’.\n Exercise 3 Read the file Table0.txt into an object DS.\nWhat is the data type for the object DS? Change the names of the columns to Name, Age, Height, Weight and Sex. Change the row names so that they are the same as Name, and remove the variable Name. Get the number of rows and columns of the data.   Exercise 4 Convert DS from the previous exercise to a data frame DF. Add an additional column “zeros” in DF with all elements 0. Remove the Weight column from DF.     "
