Teaching assistant  Name: Iegor Rudnytskyi Email: iegor.rudnytskyi@unil.ch  Learning Outcomes Upon completion of that course the students will be able to\n manage and analyze data, develop data products, and use data science in a business context.  From http://r4ds.had.co.nz\nCourse Readings There will be no mandatory reading. However, weekly readings related to the lectures are strongly recommended, and additional ressources will undoubtedly be useful.\nEvaluation Evaluation will be based on three assignments (30%) and a final project (70%). For each assignment as well as the project, students will have to provide detailed written reports. Additionally, for the project, students will give a presentation during the last lecture.\nThe final grade will be calculated using the following formula: $$GRADE = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{HW_i}{3} \\cdot 30 + PR \\cdot 70}{100},$$ where $HW_1$, $HW_2$, $HW_3$, and $PR$ are respectively the grades for the assignments and final project, on a scale from 0 to 100. This final grade will then be adjusted on a scale from 1 to 6.\nRetake exam The retake consists in asking the failing students to make modifications or additions to their written reports and to present them.\n"

	"content": " For this assignment, you will work on a real data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results.\nProject Team You may work individually or in a team. If part of a team, you will work closely with other classmates (a maximum of 2 students per team) on this project. You can come up with your own teams or use the comment section of this website to find a teammate. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find partners we can help you find a team. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each group member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member based on peer assessments (see below).\nProject Milestones There are a few milestones for your final project.\n   Date Assignment     March 15 Project proposal   April 26 Project update   May 24 Project report   May 25 Slides   May 25 Project presentation   May 26 Peer assessment    Note that:\n No extensions will be given for any of the project due dates except for medical reasons. Projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.  Deliverables There are several deliverables for your project that will be graded individually to make up your final project grade.\nProject proposal Fill out this google form to propose a project by March 15, 2020.\n The title can be changed at a later date. Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one form. At this stage, we reserve the right to reject a project proposal if it is not judged satisfactory. But the goal is mostly to set you on a path to succeed!  Project udpate Fill out this google form to update us on your project by April 26, 2020.\n Make sure that the title is final at this points. Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one form. At this stage, we reserve the right to schedule a meeting to provide additional guidance if the update is not judged satisfactory.  Project report The final report is composed of three parts:\n RMarkdown and compiled HTML files describe the project in details. A peer assessment report the contribution of each individual member. The slides from your presentation.  RMarkdown and compiled HTML The most important deliverable of your project is the set of RMarkdown and compiled HTML files by May 25, 2020. They should detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.\nYour RMarkdown should include the following topics. Depending on your project type, the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:\n Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.\n Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, or something we discussed in class.\n Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?\n Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.\n Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?\n Modeling: What are the different statistical methods you considered? Why did you choose a given model? How about competing approaches?\n Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?\n  As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your RMarkdown file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.\nAs a side note, the following scale will be used to grade projects:\n Overview, motivation, related work, research questions: 10\u0026frasl;100 Data: 15\u0026frasl;100 EDA: 30\u0026frasl;100 Modeling: 15\u0026frasl;100 Final analysis: 20\u0026frasl;100 Aesthetics, english writing, project organization, code quality: 10\u0026frasl;100 Additionally, you have the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 20\u0026frasl;100 (e.g., by using interactive visualization or presenting your work in especially interesting ways, for instance by complementing your report with a website generated with markdown).  Code We expect you to write high-quality and readable R code in your RMarkdown file. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reproducibility, efficiency, cleaning data, etc. We also expect you to document your code.\nPeer Assessment It is important to provide positive feedback to your teammate and to also make suggestions to those you perceived not to be working as effectively on team tasks. We ask you to provide an honest assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. The feedback you provide should reflect your judgment of each team member:\n Preparation: were they prepared during team meetings?\n Contribution: did they contribute productively to the team discussion and work?\n Respect for others’ ideas: did they encourage others to contribute their ideas?\n Flexibility: were they flexible when disagreements occurred?\n  Your teammates\u0026rsquo; assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall project grade. The peer assessment is due May 26, 2020. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.\nProject presentation Each team will prepare a seven minutes presentation showing a demo of your project and/or some slides.\nWe will strictly enforce the time limit, so please make sure you are not running longer. Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your presentation on your main contributions rather than on technical details. What do you feel is the best part of your project? What insights did you gain? What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end.\nWe use the following criteria to evaluate oral presentations:\n Content (4\u0026frasl;20) Organization (4\u0026frasl;20) Teamwork (4\u0026frasl;20, project done individually automatically earn the 4 points) Visuals (4\u0026frasl;20) Presentation mechanics (4\u0026frasl;20)  The project presentations will be during class on May 25, 2020, and slides should be submitted by the same day. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.\nSubmission Instructions How to submit the project proposal (due March 16, 2020) Fill out this google form to propose a project (one per team).\nHow to submit the project udpate (by April 26, 2020) Fill out this google form to update us on your project (one per team).\nHow to submit the data, RMarkdown and compiled HTML files (due May 24, 2020) Use your team\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository to commit the data used for the final project, the RMarkdown file and the compiled HTML file:\n If the data are too big to fit in the repository, make the data accessible somewhere online (google drive, downloadable link, etc). Inside the RMarkdown file at the top, include instructions on where to access the data and which packages are needed. If we cannot access your data or links because these directions are not written correctly, we will not grade your work. If we cannot reproduce your compiled HTML file by following your instructions, we will not grade your work.  How to submit the peer assessment (due May 26, 2020) Each individual team member needs to fill out this google form for the peer evaluation.\nHow to submit the presentation slides (due May 25, 2020) Please upload them on your project\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository in a slides folder.\nGrading The final project is graded in three parts:\n Project proposal (worth 5% of the grade). This portion is due March 16, 2020. Project update (worth 5% of the grade). This portion is due April 26, 2020. Project report (worth 90% of total grade). This portion will be split into two sub-portions:  80% will be based on your RMarkdown and HTML files in your GitHub repository. This includes the quality of your data analysis and R code, the complexity and level of difficulty of your project, completeness and overall functionality of your analysis. This sub-portion is due May 26, 2020. 20% will be based on your presentation and the quality of its storytelling aspects.   Your individual project grade will also be determined by your peer evaluations.\nData sources / project ideas  Governments / NGOs websites Kaggle Blog of the Data Incubator FiveThirtyEight 2016 jalous list, FiveThirtyEight 2019 jalousy list First answer to this quora question 10 great sites with free datasets  "

	"content": "R Foundations In this optional tutorial you’ll get an overview of the basic programming concepts in R and main data types. Just enough to get you up and running essenial R code. However, for true “beginners”, we highly recommend going through Advanced R - Chapter ‘Foundations’ from which the content of this assignment is mainly (mostly) inspired by.\nR, RStudio, Installation  R is a programming language for statistical analysis RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) for R in which we write and execute R code, plot things and write reports. Installation guidelines and details (Mac, Windows, Linux)  To follow the tutorial, you can start R Studio and execute statements from the code chuncks in the R Console.\n Libraries R uses different libraries or packages to load specific functions (read excel files, talk to Twitter, generate plots).\n# install package from RStudio console # ** Note the quotation marks! # install.packages(\u0026quot;name_of_package\u0026quot;) # load package in enviromnet library(blogdown)  Ex. 0 As a starting point you can install the packages we’ll extensively use throughout the semester:\n readr tidyverse    Assignment In R, we assign values (numbers, characters, data frames) to objects (vectors, matricies, variables). To do so, we use the \u0026lt;- operator:\n# name_of_object \u0026lt;- value an_object \u0026lt;- 2 another_object \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;some string\u0026quot; # inspect object\u0026#39;s value an_object ## [1] 2 print(another_object) ## [1] \u0026quot;some string\u0026quot;  Data Structures R’s base data structures can be organised by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types).\n   Homogeneous Heterogeneous    1d Atomic vector List  2d Matrix Data frame  nd Array      Vectors The basic data structure in R is the vector. Vectors can be of two kinds: atomic vectors and lists. They have three common properties:\n Type, typeof(), what it is. Length, length(), how many elements it contains. Attributes, attributes(), additional arbitrary metadata. They differ in the types of their elements: all elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.  There are four common types of atomic vectors:\n logical integer double (often called numeric) character  Atomic vectors are usually created with c(), short for combine:\ndbl_var \u0026lt;- c(1, 2.5, 4.5) # with the L suffix, you get an integer rather than a double int_var \u0026lt;- c(1L, 6L, 10L) # use TRUE and FALSE (or T and F) to create logical vectors log_var \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F) chr_var \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;these are\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;some strings\u0026quot;) int_var \u0026lt;- c(1L, 6L, 10L) typeof(int_var) ## [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; is.integer(int_var) ## [1] TRUE  Lists List objects can hold elements of any type, including lists. You construct lists by using list() instead of c():\nx \u0026lt;- list(1:3, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9)) str(x) ## List of 4 ## $ : int [1:3] 1 2 3 ## $ : chr \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; ## $ : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE ## $ : num [1:2] 2.3 5.9  Attributes All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object. Attributes can be thought of as a named list (with unique names). They can be accessed individually with attr() or all at once (as a list) with attributes().\ny \u0026lt;- 1:10 attr(y, \u0026quot;my_attribute\u0026quot;) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;This is a vector\u0026quot; # inspect the attribute of y attr(y, \u0026quot;my_attribute\u0026quot;) ## [1] \u0026quot;This is a vector\u0026quot;  Matrices and arrays Adding a dim attribute to an atomic vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array. A special case of the array is the matrix, which has two dimensions. Matrices and arrays are created with matrix() and array(), or by using the assignment form of dim():\n# two scalar arguments to specify rows and columns a \u0026lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3, nrow = 2) # one vector argument to describe all dimensions b \u0026lt;- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2)) # you can also modify an object in place by setting dim() c \u0026lt;- 1:6 dim(c) \u0026lt;- c(3, 2) c ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 length() and names() have high-dimensional generalisations:\n length() generalises to nrow() and ncol() for matrices, and dim() for arrays.\n names() generalises to rownames() and colnames() for matrices, and dimnames(), a list of character vectors, for arrays.\n  c() generalises to cbind() and rbind() for matrices, and to abind() (provided by the abind package) for arrays. You can transpose a matrix with t(); the generalised equivalent for arrays is aperm().\nYou can test if an object is a matrix or array using is.matrix() and is.array(), or by looking at the length of the dim(). as.matrix() and as.array() make it easy to turn an existing vector into a matrix or array.\n Data frames A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and if used systematically makes data analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of both the matrix and the list. This means that a data frame has names(), colnames(), and rownames(), although names() and colnames() are the same thing. The length() of a data frame is the length of the underlying list and so is the same as ncol(); nrow() gives the number of rows.\ndf \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;)) str(df) ## \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 3 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ x: int 1 2 3 ## $ y: Factor w/ 3 levels \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;: 1 2 3 You can combine data frames using cbind() and rbind():\ncbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1)) ## x y z ## 1 1 a 3 ## 2 2 b 2 ## 3 3 c 1  Subsetting vectors Let’s explore the different types of subsetting with a simple vector, x.\nx \u0026lt;- c(2, 4, 3, 5) Positive integers return elements at the specified positions:\nx[c(3, 1)] ## [1] 3 2 Duplicated indices yield duplicated values\nx[c(1, 1)] ## [1] 2 2 Real numbers are silently truncated to integers\nx[c(2, 9)] ## [1] 4 NA Negative integers omit elements at the specified positions:\nx[-c(3, 1)] ## [1] 4 5 You can’t mix positive and negative integers in a single subset: x[c(-1, 2)]\nLogical vectors select elements where the corresponding logical value is TRUE. This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector:\nx[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)] ## [1] 2 4 x[x \u0026gt; 3] ## [1] 4 5 A missing value in the index always yields a missing value in the output:\nx[c(TRUE, TRUE, NA, FALSE)] ## [1] 2 4 NA Nothing returns the original vector. This is not useful for vectors but is very useful for matrices, data frames, and arrays. It can also be useful in conjunction with assignment.\nx[] ## [1] 2 4 3 5 Zero returns a zero-length vector. This is not something you usually do on purpose, but it can be helpful for generating test data.\nx[0] ## numeric(0) If the vector is named, you can also use character vectors to return elements with matching names:\n(y \u0026lt;- setNames(x, letters[1:4])) ## a b c d ## 2 4 3 5 y[c(\u0026quot;d\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)] ## d c a ## 5 3 2 Like integer indices, you can repeat indices:\ny[c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)] ## a a a ## 2 2 2 When subsetting with [ names are always matched exactly\nz \u0026lt;- c(abc = 1, def = 2) z[c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;)] ## \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## NA NA  Subsetting lists, matricies and data frames Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using [ will always return a list; [[ and $, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.\nYou can subset higher-dimensional structures in three ways:\n With multiple vectors. With a single vector. With a matrix.  a \u0026lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3) colnames(a) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;) # multiple vectors a[1:2, ] ## A B C ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 df \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1, z = letters[1:3]) # selecting by value of certain vector df[df$x == 2, ] ## x y z ## 2 2 2 b  Importing data in R The following checklist makes it easier to import data correctly into R:\n The first row is maybe reserved for the header, while the first column is used to identify the sampling unit; Avoid names, values or fields with blank spaces, otherwise each word will be interpreted as a separate variable, resulting in errors that are related to the number of elements per line in your data set; Short names are prefered over longer names; Try to avoid using names that contain symbols such as ?, $,%, ^, \u0026amp;, *, (, ),-,#, ?,,,\u0026lt;,\u0026gt;, /, |, , [ ,] ,{, and }; Make sure that any missing values in your data set are indicated with NA.  library(readr) # import data from .txt file df \u0026lt;- read_table( \u0026quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.txt\u0026quot;, col_names = FALSE) df ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## X1 X2 X3 ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 6 a ## 2 2 7 b ## 3 3 8 c ## 4 4 9 d ## 5 5 10 e # import data from .csv file df \u0026lt;- read.table( \u0026quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.csv\u0026quot;, header = TRUE, sep = \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;)  Functions Standard format for defining a function in R:\nmy_function_name \u0026lt;- function(arg1 = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, arg2 = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;) { # \u0026#39;cat\u0026#39; is used for concatenating strings merged_string \u0026lt;- cat(arg1, arg2) # if not specified, last evaluated object is returned return(merged_string) } # call a function elsewhere from code arg1 \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot; arg2 \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;World!\u0026quot; a_greeting \u0026lt;- my_function_name(arg1, arg2) ## Hello World!  print(a_greeting) ## NULL CRAN - the curated repository of R packages provides millions of functions that you could use to tackle data. You simply need to install a package, and then call the function from your R code function_name(somearguments). For example, the package stats helps you in fitting linear model through the function lm():\nlibrary(stats) x \u0026lt;- rnorm(500) y \u0026lt;- x*4 + rnorm(500) lm.fit \u0026lt;- lm(y~x, data = data.frame(x, y)) print(lm.fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x, data = data.frame(x, y)) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) x ## 0.03852 3.94346 How many functions have been used in the example? What does rnorm mean? You can get informed about any R function by using its documentation ?function_name or ?packageName::function_name.\n Cheat sheets Base R Cheat sheet  Data Types Cheat sheet   Try it yourself! Exercise 1 Try to figure out the answers without executing the code. Check your answers in R Studio.\nGiven the vector: x \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;ww\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ee\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ff\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;uu\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kk\u0026quot;), what will be the output for x[c(2,3)] ?\n Let a \u0026lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8) and b \u0026lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), what will be the output for the R expression max(a[b])?\n Is it possible to apply the function my_function_name using x and a as arguments?\n   Exercise 2 Consider a vector x such that: x=c(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29) Write an R statement that will return a list X2 with components of value: x*2, x/2, sqrt(x) and names ‘x*2’, ‘x/2’, ‘sqrt(x)’.\n Exercise 3 Read the file Table0.txt into an object DS.\nWhat is the data type for the object DS? Change the names of the columns to Name, Age, Height, Weight and Sex. Change the row names so that they are the same as Name, and remove the variable Name. Get the number of rows and columns of the data.   Exercise 4 Convert DS from the previous exercise to a data frame DF. Add an additional column “zeros” in DF with all elements 0. Remove the Weight comuln from DF.     "

	"content": " Data Science for Business Analytics The aim of this course is to learn the most important tools to use data science in a business context, and includes concepts from statistics and computer science:\n Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to clean data and draw plots and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You\u0026rsquo;ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.  Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham \n The course will cover the following topics:\n Explore  Data visualization Data transformation Exploratory data analysis  Wrangle  Tidy data Relational data Strings, factors, dates and times  Model  The basis Model building Many models  Communicate  Literate programming Graphics for communication   From http://r4ds.had.co.nz\nAs the class will be hands-on and centered around data, bringing your laptop to lectures and exercise sessions is recommended.\n"
