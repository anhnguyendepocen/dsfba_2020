# In the morning

* Drink coffee

# During the day

## Work

* Writing some R code

```{r}
2 + 2
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
x <- tibble(x1 = rnorm(1e2),
            x2 = rnorm(1e2))
```

* The dataframe has `r ncol(x)` variables and `r nrow(x)` observations.
* The mean of x1 is `r round(mean(x$x1), digits = 3)`.

* Do some statistics

If $X \sim Bin(n,p)$ then $P(X=x)=\binom{n}{x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$.

## Dinner

* Eat spaghetti
* Drink wine
