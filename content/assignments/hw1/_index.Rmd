[Download the HW1 skeleton files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvatter/dsfba_2020/master/static/skeletons/dsfba_homework1_skeleton.zip). To successfully complete the first assignment you
will have to do the following:

1. Create a new project with the name `homework1.Rproj`.
2. Organize the files in the right folders to provide ease of building a final
`HW1_report.Rmd` = `hw1_ex1.Rmd` + `hw1_ex2.Rmd` + `hw1_ex3.Rmd`.
3. Following the instructions below, complete missing code in chunks in `hw1_ex1.Rmd`, `hw1_ex2.Rmd` and `hw1_ex3.Rmd`. 


To obtain the maximum number of points, use whenever possible:

* the pipeline symbol `%>%`,
* `dplyr` verbs (see below),
* `kable` to print tables,
* `ggplot` to produce the figures.


| verb | description |
| :---  | :---  | :---:  |
| `select()` | select columns |
| `filter()` | filter rows |
| `arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows |
| `mutate()` | create new columns |
| `summarise()` | summarise values |
| `group_by()` | group operations |

#### Revise writing report using RMarkdown

<!-- __Q1.__ To showcase your successful project organisation, start your report by -->
<!-- providing the code and output for listing all files in your current directory  -->
<!-- and subdirectories. -->

#### Data transformation hands-on

Once you're environment is set up, you're ready to get your hands dirty with 
some data manipulation. Following the instructions provided in "R workflow and
RMarkdown", you should be able to solve the following assignments:

 * Exercise 1: Setup
 * Exercise 2: Edgar Anderson's Iris Data
 * Exercise 3: House Prices


Begin by writing your code in the corresponding code chuncks in `hw1_ex1.Rmd`,
`hw1_ex2.Rmd` and `hw1_ex3.Rmd`. When you finish the three exercises, use `Knitr` to render the
full report `HW1_report.Rmd`.
Don't forget to save your files and keep them ready and clean for the next session. 


#### Exercise 1: Setup

__* Connecting to remote repository__

To submit your homework you should connect to your assigned repository. If you need some help, follow the instructions on [this link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/), Section: *Clone an existing GitHub project to new RStudio project*.

__Project Setup 'homework1.Rproj'__

Use the files provided in `dsfba_homework1.zip` to structure your project in the following way (you should create subdirectories by yourselves):

__1.a__ Install the tidyverse and knitr.

__1.b__ Load the tidyverse and knitr.



#### Notes on the grading

* 1 point "per command" (e.g., there are 3 in both 2a and 2b), dplyr verbs/helper functions such as desc/assignments counts as "1 command".
* 2 points per interpretation.
* 1 point "per aesthetics" (counting x and y as a single aesthetic, but color/pch and others separately) + 1 point "per geom" + 1 point for labels/titles in general.
* 1 points per call to kable (should be "polished" to get full points for the `kable` column).
