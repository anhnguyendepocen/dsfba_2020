[Download the HW1 skeleton files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvatter/dsfba_2020/master/static/skeletons/dsfba_homework1_skeleton.zip). To successfully complete the first assignment you
will have to do the following:

1. Create a new project with the name `homework1.Rproj`.
2. Following the instructions below, complete missing code in chunks in `hw1_ex1.Rmd`, `hw1_ex2.Rmd`, `hw1_ex3.Rmd` and `hw1_ex4.Rmd`. 
3. Build the final report `hw1_report.Rmd` = `hw1_ex1.Rmd` + `hw1_ex2.Rmd` + `hw1_ex3.Rmd` + `hw1_ex3.Rmd`.


To obtain the maximum number of points, use whenever possible:

* the pipeline symbol `%>%`,
* `dplyr` verbs (see below),
* `kable` to print tables,
* `ggplot` to produce the figures.


| verb | description |
| :---  | :---  | :---:  |
| `select()` | select columns |
| `filter()` | filter rows |
| `arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows |
| `mutate()` | create new columns |
| `summarise()` | summarise values |
| `group_by()` | group operations |

#### Revise writing report using RMarkdown

<!-- providing the code and output for listing all files in your current directory  -->
<!-- and subdirectories. -->

#### Data transformation hands-on

Once you're environment is set up, you're ready to get your hands dirty with 
some data manipulation:

 * Exercise 1: Setup
 * Exercise 2: Motor Trend Car Road Tests
 * Exercise 3: New York Air Quality Measurements
 * Exercise 4: Armed Conflicts, Visualization and Fact Checking

Begin by writing your code in the corresponding code chuncks in `hw1_ex1.Rmd`,
`hw1_ex2.Rmd`, `hw1_ex3.Rmd` and `hw1_ex4.Rmd`. Then, use `Knitr` to render the
full report `hw1_report.Rmd`.
Don't forget to save your files and keep them ready and clean for the next session. 

#### Exercise 1: Setup

__Connecting to remote repository__

To submit your homework you should connect to your assigned repository. If you need some help, follow the instructions on [this link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/), Section: *Clone an existing GitHub project to new RStudio project*.

__Project Setup 'homework1.Rproj'__

Use the files provided in the skeleton to structure your project in the following way:

#### Notes on the grading

Essentially, the points are counted as follows:

* 1 point "per command", dplyr verbs/helper functions such as desc/assignments counts as "1 command".
* 2 points per interpretation.
* 1 point "per aesthetics" (counting x and y as a single aesthetic, but color/pch and others separately) + 1 point "per geom" + 1 point for labels/titles in general.
* 1 points per call to kable (should be "polished" to get full points for the `kable` column).
