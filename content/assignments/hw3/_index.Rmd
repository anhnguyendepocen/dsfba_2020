[Download the HW3 skeleton files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvatter/dsfba_2020/master/static/skeletons/dsfba_homework3_skeleton.zip). To successfully complete the first assignment you
will have to do the following:

1. Following the instructions below, complete missing code in chunks in `report/eda.Rmd`, `report/swiss_model.Rmd`, and `report/many_models.Rmd`. 
2. Add your name and build the final report using `index.Rmd`. 


To obtain the maximum number of points, use whenever possible:

* the pipeline symbol %>%,
* `dplyr` verbs,
* `kable` to print tables,
* `ggplot` to produce the figures,
* `purrr`'s functions to minimize code duplication,
* `broom`'s functions to format the results model fits.

Also: 

* Pay attention to the general aesthetics of your report (i.e., formatting of 
the tables, sizing of the figures, etc.). 
* Use inline code to display single numbers, and `echo = FALSE` for code chunks when you display 
a table of produce a figure (i.e., we don't want to see code unless it is necessary).
* Minimize the amount of code duplication by using iterations concepts and list-columns.
* Comment your code to explain what you are doing.
